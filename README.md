# Writing Good Documentation

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks.

Codeblocks in markdown make it *very easy* for tech people to **copy, paste, share** code.
A good __Cloud Engineer__ uses Codeblocks whenever possible.

Because it allows others to copy and past their code to replicate or research issues.


- In order to create codeblocks in markdown you need to use three backticks (`)
- Not to be confused with quotation (')

```
# Create an empty array to store names
names = []

# Get names from the user until they enter an empty string
loop do
  print "Enter a name (or press Enter to finish): "
  name = gets.chomp
  break if name.empty?
  names << name
end

# Sort the names alphabetically
sorted_names = names.sort

# Display the sorted names
puts "Sorted Names:"
sorted_names.each do |name|
  puts name
end
```

- When you can you should attempt to apply syntax highlighting to your codeblocks.

```ruby
# Create an empty array to store names
names = []

# Get names from the user until they enter an empty string
loop do
  print "Enter a name (or press Enter to finish): "
  name = gets.chomp
  break if name.empty?
  names << name
end

# Sort the names alphabetically
sorted_names = names.sort

# Display the sorted names
puts "Sorted Names:"
sorted_names.each do |name|
  puts name
end
```

- Make note of where the backtick button is located.
- It should appear above the tab key,
- but it may vary based on your keyboard layout.

Good Cloud Engineers use codeblocks for both Code and Errors that appear in the console
```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
  sample.rb:3:in `<main>'
sample.rb:3:in `[]': index 1 outside of array bounds (IndexError)
```

> Here is an example of using a codeblock for an error that appears in bash.

## Step 3 - Use Github Flavoured Markdown Task Lists

Github extends Markdown to hava a list where you can check off items. [<sup>[1]</sup>](#external-references)

- [ ] Finish Step 2
- [x] Finish Step 3

# Step 4 - Use Emojis (Optional)

Github Flavoured Markdown (GFM) supports emoji shortcodes.
Here are some examples:

| Name | ShortCode | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cloud | :cloud: | :cloud: |
| cloud with lighting | `:cloud_with_lighting` | üå©Ô∏è |

# Step 5 - how to create a table


You can use the following markdown format to create tables:

```md
| Name | ShortCode | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cloud | :cloud: | :cloud: |
| cloud with lighting | `:cloud_with_lighting` | üå©Ô∏è |
```
 Github extends the functionality of Markdown tables to provide more alignment and table cell formatting options. [<sup>[2]</sup>](#external-references)
